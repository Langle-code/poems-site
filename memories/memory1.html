    <h2>Memory I</h2>
    <p>
        you're older<br>
        you're older now<br>
        so am I<br>
        so we are.<br>
        but we once were-<br>
        once were younger,<br>
        once were naive,<br>
        once were bolder -<br> 
        maybe we still are,<br>
        still young,<br>
        still naive,<br>
        still bold -<br>
        but it's gotten muddled<br>
        our eyes don't see as clearly as before<br>
        but we were once-<br>
        once together,<br>
        and now we're not.<br> 
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>
        and that's fine.<br>
        our tired eyes have seen more<br>
        than what we saw before<br>
        our tired minds have gained more perspective.<br> 
        and that's more than fine.<br>
        and someday, we'll be fine too.<br>
        fine with how things unraveled,<br>
        fine with how things ended,<br>
        fine with how we ended.<br>
        because every end signals a new chapter,<br>
        and although you won't be in mine,<br>
        and I won't be in yours,<br> 
        we once were-<br>
        and we'll always be -<br>
        side by side<br>
        in that chapter of when we were younger.
